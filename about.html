                    <h3>The Story So Far</h3>
                    <p>After years of running plays, concerts, and events as the head of audio for the black box Cabaret Theater, I graduated from Emerson College in Boston with a degree in Sound Design & 
                        Audio Post-Production. My first job after I moved to Los Angeles was as a sound editor, primarily for television. From there, I transitioned from engineering to supervision within 
                        post-production and began working as a post-production manager for film trailers. I managed assets for theatrical, television, and digital ad spots for movies 
                        including <i>Deadpool</i>, <i>Logan</i>, <i>The Martian</i>, and <i>The Revenant</i>, which allowed me to blend my familiarity with the technical side of things with 
                        my organizational prowess. Because I had been in the trenches as a dialogue editor, I was able to effectively communicate with both sides of the client desk. I could 
                        talk shop with the artists and engineers, and I could confidently relay that information all the way up the chain. This is where I honed my ability to communicate technical 
                        information to non-technical stakeholders, a skill that has been crucial in my subsequent roles</p>
                    
                    <p>Managing complex post-production workflows gave me the confidence to branch out of entertainment, and I took on several project management and business analysis consultant 
                        roles across different industries, managing several long-term software development and deployment projects. I then returned to the world of post-production, securing a role as 
                        a Post Producer and Project Manager at Levels Audio, where I had the pleasure of  working on shows such as <i>The Bachelor</i>, <i>American Idol</i>, and <i>The Masked Singer</i>, 
                        as well as awards shows such as the MTV Video Music Awards, in addition to the Academy Award-winning short film <i>Two Distant Strangers.</i> </p>
                    
                    <p>After parting ways with Levels in order to further expand my horizons, I returned to consulting with an increased focus on data and business analysis, extending my experience to 
                        additional industries including sales, design, manufacturing, construction, events, and retail. In 2023, I earned a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the 
                        Project Management Institute, fortifying my years of hands-on experience with deep knowledge of industry best practices and specific methodologies for all types of projects.</p>

                    <h3>Beyond the Resume</h3>
                    <p>When I'm not managing projects or designing solutions, you'll find me exploring the intersection of creativity and technology through personal projects. I'm passionate about video and 
                        tabletop games, TTRPGs, 3D printing and modeling, music, film, television, and graphic and narrative design. The long and short of it is this: I like to make things, be it through art, 
                        engineering, or both.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing. Whether it's mentoring junior team members, contributing open-source projects, or developing educational content,
                         I'm committed to helping others learn and grow.</p>
